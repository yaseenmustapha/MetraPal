# MetraPal

An application built in Swift for iOS devices that allows for seamless viewing and live tracking of Metra trains in the Chicagoland area.

Hits the [Metra GTFS API](https://metra.com/metra-gtfs-api) to overlay geospatial train position data, draw metra line polylines, and display relevant stop data for a selected train.
Queries the API every 30 seconds to get the latest information available.

Uses MapKit to deliver a fast, smooth, and familiar map experience to Apple Maps. Also enables for overlaying the user's current position if they allow it.
